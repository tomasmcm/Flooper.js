## Writing some Code
1. Fork the project
1. clone the repo:
1. [Setup](./)
1. Push to your fork and Submit a pull request

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

## Improving the Documentation
Not easy to get started or use the code. Maybe it's not your fault. Report it!

## Reporting a Bug
Before reporting make sure you've scanned trhough the list of open and closed issues. There's a change that other have reported it or that it might have been already solved but new circunstances apply.

Template should be more or less like:
- Expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Too hard to explain by words? include a demo!
- Specifications like the version of the project, operating system, or hardware.
- Be nice. Or leave.
